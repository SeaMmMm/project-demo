## CSS Grid

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.

### Grid Container

The element on which display: grid is applied. It's the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example container is the grid container.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```

### Grid Item

The children (e.g. direct descendants) of the grid container. Here the item class is a grid item.

```css
.item {
  grid-column: span 2;
}
```

### Grid Line

The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be vertical or horizontal.

### Grid Track

The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them like the columns or rows of the grid.

### Grid Cell

The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It's a single "unit" of the grid.

### Grid Area

The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be comprised of any number of grid cells.

### Grid Gap

The space between rows and columns in a grid.
