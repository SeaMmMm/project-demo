# JS

## 1. Introduction

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

## 2. Syntax

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

### 2.1. Statements

A JavaScript program is a list of statements. A statement is a command that the interpreter can execute. Here's an example of a statement:

```javascript
a = b * 2 + foo(c)
```

### 2.2. Expressions

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

```javascript
a = b * 2
```

### 2.3. Literals

A literal is a data value that appears directly in a program.

```javascript
12
```

## 3. Variables

A variable is a container for a value. You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computer's memory.

### 3.1. Declaring Variables

You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword:

```javascript
var x
x = 6
var y = 7
```

### 3.2. Variable Scope

When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
