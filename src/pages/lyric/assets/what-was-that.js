[00:04.814]A place in the city
[00:08.669]A chair and a bed
[00:12.523]I cover up all the mirrors
[00:15.451]Can't see myself yet
[00:20.027]I wear smoke like a wedding veil
[00:23.776]Make a meal I won't eat
[00:26.355]Step out into the street
[00:28.094]Alone in a sea it comes over me
[00:33.659]Oh I'm missing you
[00:37.266]Yeah I'm missing you
[00:40.324]And all the things we used to do
[00:42.239]**** in the back garden blow our pupils up
[00:45.958]We kissed for hours straight well baby what was that?
[00:49.611]I remember saying then this is the best cigarette of my life
[00:54.822]Well I want you just like that
[00:57.494]Indio haze we're in a sandstorm and it knocks me out
[01:01.011]I didn't know then that you'd never be enough
[01:04.849]Since I was seventeen I gave you everything
[01:08.031]Now we wake from a dream well baby what was that?
[01:18.657]What was that?
[01:25.625]Baby what was that?
[01:27.985]Do you know you're still with me
[01:31.737]When I'm out with my friends?
[01:35.546]I stare at their painted faces
[01:38.108]They talk current affairs
[01:43.109]You had to know this was happening
[01:46.859]You weren't feeling my heat
[01:49.211]When I'm in the blue light down at Baby's All Right I face reality
[01:57.151]I try (I try) to let (to let)
[02:00.999]Whatever has to pass through me pass through
[02:05.674]But this is staying a while I know
[02:10.361]It might not let me go
[02:20.414]**** in the back garden blow our pupils up
[02:24.126]We kissed for hours straight well baby what was that?
[02:28.055]I remember saying then this is the best cigarette of my life
[02:33.119]Well I want you just like that
[02:35.663]Indio haze we're in a sandstorm and it knocks me out
[02:39.297]I didn't know then that you'd never be enough
[02:43.102]Since I was seventeen I gave you everything
[02:46.288]Now we wake from a dream well baby what was that?
[02:56.973]What was that?
[03:03.342]Cause I want you just like that
[03:05.144]When I'm in the blue light I can make it alright
[03:12.031]What was that?
[03:12.589]When I'm in the blue light I can make it alright
[03:18.897]Baby what was that?
