[00:00.000]I Really Want to Stay at Your House - Samuel Kim/Lorien
[00:01.799]I couldn't wait for you to come clear the cupboards
[00:09.405]But now you're going to leave with nothing but a sign
[00:17.168]Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines
[00:24.698]Because I miss you all the time
[00:30.760]So get away
[00:33.103]Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
[00:37.233]And let yourself go
[00:40.157]You know you didn't lose your self-control
[00:44.147]Let's start at the rainbow
[00:47.067]Turn away
[00:48.499]Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
[00:52.946]Let yourself go
[00:55.652]Is that a compromise
[01:00.856]So what do you wanna do what's your point-of-view
[01:04.928]There's a party soon do you wanna go
[01:08.695]A handshake with you what's your point-of-view
[01:12.495]I'm on top of you I don't wanna go
[01:15.841]'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
[01:19.948]And I hope this works out
[01:23.508]But you know how much you broke me apart
[01:26.359]I'm done with you I'm ignoring you
[01:29.832]I don't wanna know
[01:41.621]And I'm aware that you were lying in the gutter
[01:49.243]'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide
[01:56.954]So when you tell me I'm the reason I just can't believe the lies
[02:04.627]And why do I so want to call you
[02:07.223]Call you call you call you
[02:10.079]So what do you wanna do what's your point-of-view
[02:13.983]There's a party soon do you wanna go
[02:17.787]A handshake with you what's your point-of-view
[02:21.681]I'm on top of you I don't wanna go
[02:25.034]'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
[02:29.087]And I hope this works out
[02:32.688]But you know how much you broke me apart
[02:35.567]I'm done with you I'm ignoring you
[02:38.871]I don't wanna know
[02:42.076]You
[02:48.636]Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
[02:51.255]I don't know why I'm no-one
[02:56.652]So get away
